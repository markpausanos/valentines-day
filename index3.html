            Dear Charisse,
            <br><br>
            I hope this letter finds you well today, and it is the rightful day where people express their
            <br>love to whom they admire. You will have become a subject to my letters because of that 
            <br>one fateful moment of truth that had made me defenseless. Think of it as an art of 
            <br>vanquishing, I have long planned an offensive to your heart so that I conquer it first 
            <br>exquisitely. I have made several preparations so that I will have great chances of success. 
            <br>You, however, conquered me first. I did not prepare for a defensive plan. I was very 
            <br>oblivious with what to do next, as I might step on a landmine with my words. But then 
            <br>unexpectedly, this mind planned out a counter-offensive in three days. It had to be done. 
            <br>A fateful decision to which I cherish to this day, and so I hope you do too. I hope that we 
            <br>now will move forward to developing our relationship and ourselves. I have done quite 
            <br>ample research on how to become a better lover for you. It sounds funny but it is how my 
            <br>thoughts work. I know we will face challenges in the future, right? No matter. You stay 
            <br>adorable, admirable, and ambitious. I hope to face those challenge with you by my side.
            <br><br>Lovingly yours,
            <br>Mark
